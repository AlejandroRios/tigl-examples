# Contributing

If you have any examples that you would like to share with the community, please create a Pull-Request or send an email to tigl@dlr.de.

For consistency reasons, we should try to make sure that the following requirements are met by every new example:

 - All examples should be referenced in the root [README.md](README.md) with a link to a short description, see next bullet point.
 - If the example can be run using binder, we should add a binder link to every TOC entry that references the example.
 - Each subdirectory contains a `README.md`. This file should contain 
   - an entry in the TOC to link to a short description in the same file.
   - a short description of the example with a link to the actual example file/example folder.
- If the example consists of several files, add them to a directory. If it makes sense, add a `README.md` to the example directory with a long description of the example
 - We should keep the examples in an alphabetical order in the READMEs.
 - Please provide an image with every example CPACS configuration.
